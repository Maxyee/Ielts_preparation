# My Answer:
I have just a few minutes to tell you about a website I often browse. I will tell you what the website is, how long Iâ€™ve been using it, 
a bit about what is on it and why I visit it so often. 

The name of the website is StackOverFlow. Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.
You can find it at https://stackoverflow.com/ but I just have it as a favourite bookmark in my google chrome browser. As I am a programmer
I always visit the website several times a day. I have been using it for the past 4 years or more. At first I found this website when I was
an university student. There was a course called 'software engineering' where I needed to submit a website project and this stackoverflow 
website solutions always helped me a lot.


The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Reddit.Users of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and "badges"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on an answer given to a question and 5 points for the "up" vote of a question, and can receive badges for their valued contributions,which represents a kind of gamification of the traditional Q&A site. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.


The Stackoverflow website. for me, is one of the best solution platform for all types of coding error. I really love this website 
because when I stuck in a problem when developing any web application ,It gives me the right way and the right solution to me. Into 
the Stackoverflow website there is search job section which really helpful to me to find out the best companies in the world. From that section I can gather new technology knowledge and also I can maintain my learning process in different technology. I can focas on that 
technology for learning which is mostly questioned and answered into the website. Another most valuable thing stackoverflow share is 
that there survey report. Each and every year the website give a survey notice to all of the programmer of that website and find the 
informatic data which can give programmers the ultimate goal of their life. I keep myself up to date with this website also I am trying to
enrich my profile reputation which will help me to find out a better jobs in Stackoverflow Job section.
